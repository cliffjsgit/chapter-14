#Chapter 14 - README.md

In these review exercises, you will be reviewing the basic Python techniques that are presented in the exercises of Think Python Chapter 14. 

Start by cloning the Chapter 14 Exercises into you local repository.
     
     $ cd ~
     $ git clone https://github.com/cliffjsgit/chapter-14
     

Once you have cloned this repo, you may proceed to the labs.
    
     $ cd ~/chapter-14
     ~/chapter-14 (master)$ ls
     ...

Create a solutions directory for your exercise solutions, in the chapter-14 directory.
      
     ~/chapter-14 (master)$ mkdir solutions
      
Copy all of your final/completed chapter-14 lab **exercise solutions** from all exercise 
problems, the **sed_tester.txt**, the **words.txt**, the **mp3** directory files, and  
**anagram_sets.py** into the solutions directory.  
    
     ~/chapter-14 (master)$ cp *  solutions/ 
     ...
    
Make sure that you copy all of your completed exercise solutions and the other files
from this chapter into your **single**  ~/chapter14/solutions directory, 
preserving the orignal file names of these files.
